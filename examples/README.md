# Sparkfun Joystick Examples Reference
Below is a brief summary of each of the example programs included in this repository. To report a bug in any of these examples or to request a new feature or example [submit an issue in our GitHub issues.](https://github.com/sparkfun/qwiic_joystick_py/issues). 

NOTE: Any numbering of examples is to retain consistency with the Arduino library from which this was ported. 

## Qwiic Joystick Ex1
Simple Example for the Qwiic Joystick Device that reads the x and y coordinates of the joystick. 

The key properties/methods showcased by this example are:
- 
- [horizontal/get_horizontal](https://docs.sparkfun.com/qwiic_joystick_py/classqwiic__joystick_1_1_qwiic_joystick.html#afd43dffa6db5c5d0d0de1ac3ad990a54)
- [vertical/get_vertical](https://docs.sparkfun.com/qwiic_joystick_py/classqwiic__joystick_1_1_qwiic_joystick.html#ab71eee9de98b17c2e5f287ada385bbab)
- [button/get_button](https://docs.sparkfun.com/qwiic_joystick_py/classqwiic__joystick_1_1_qwiic_joystick.html#a2f3a8569523dc67553dc0dcf4c47a8b6)

## Qwiic Joystick Ex2
Simple Example for the Qwiic Joystick Device that prints when an Up (U), Down (D), Right (R), or Left(L) joystick movement occurs.

This example uses the same properties/methods as example 1, but shows how to interpret the values.
